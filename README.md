# Covert-Communication-in-MEC

Employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to enhance stealth communication in UAV-enabled networks. 
The purpose is to extend the communication between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their receivers 
securely and without interruption and to reduce the chances of an eavesdropper intercepting the communication. 
First, each UAV also adapts good choices of Age of Information that when it will transmit data and how it would do
that, with concerning the energy and stealthiness. With Q-learning, UAVs learn new actions
regarding the way of sending data and avoiding being detected through time. The project proves
that DDoS attack detection risk decreases by 90%, data gets fresher, and energy consumption is
more efficient as compared to conventional methods making it a worthy contender for secure
applications like IoT, smart cities and healthcare networks.
